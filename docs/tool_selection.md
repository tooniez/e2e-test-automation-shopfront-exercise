# Test Automation Framework

For this application, I have chosen Playwright as the test automation framework.

## Reasons for choosing Playwright over Cypress:

The reasons of selection were below:

- Multi-threaded architecture
- Various Test Types
- Flexibility
- Various Languages
- Mobile Devices


Below is a table to show some comparisons of Cypress vs Playwright.
